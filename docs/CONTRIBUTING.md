# Contributing to Migaloo

Welcome! We are thrilled that you want to contribute to White Whale Migaloo Bots! Consider that there are many ways in which you can contribute, 
it's not only about writing code. In this document we go through different ways you can get involved with the project.

## Crafting Code

If you are a software developer and want to contribute writing code for the bots, the first step is to get familiar with 
the Migaloo architecture, which you can learn about in our [docs](https://white-whale-defi-platform.github.io/docs/).

Before you can write any code, please take a look at the list of prerequisites below.  

### Prerequisites

To download the necessary tools, clone the repository and so on, you need network access.

The following are the tools you'll need:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- An IDE. We recommend either [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), 

--- 
Then fork the code and read it through. We encourage you to make your own contributions, though you might look at the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/migaloo-bots/issues) if you want to solve something that has 
been pointed out already.

Make a pull request to our repository once your work is complete. We will review it and discuss potential changes before
we merge it to the main code base.

## Helping out in the issue tracker

We use [Github issues](https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/migaloo-bots/issues) to manage issues in our bot code. 
You can help out by resolving or commenting on existing issues or creating new issues for what you find. Whether you want 
to report an issue or have a feature request, please fill the issue template and provide as much information as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please search through the open issues and make sure the issue or feature request has not 
been made by someone else already.

If the issue or feature request already exists, please add a üëç reaction to show your support and leave your comments on it, that way we can prioritize accordingly.

## Quality Assurance

Code quality and security are two things we take seriously at White Whale. We strive for having high test coverage, and 
we make sure our code is safe by auditing via third party security firms. Nevertheless, we believe there's always room for improvement. 

If you find a critical vulnerability, please do not report it publicly on the Github issues tracker. Instead, reach out to us 
in private where we will discuss it in details.

See how to [report security bugs](./SECURITY.md).

## Engaging with the community

If you are interested in developer relations, a great way to contribute is answering people's questions on our 
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tSxyyCWgYX), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WhiteWhaleDefi) or [Telegram](https://t.me/whitewhaleofficial) 
channels, creating documentation in our Wiki, creating medium articles or even creating YouTube tutorials on how to use our flashloans!

## Providing Suggestions

White Whale is a community project, we are curious to hear your ideas for the future of Migaloo! One way to provide feedback
is by doing to our [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/908044702794801233/908044703373606954). You can also
submit a suggestion or feature request through [Github's issue tracker](https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/migaloo-bots/issues). 
When doing so, make sure to describe your idea as good as possible so that we understand what you envision.

## Bringing your expertise

Are you a graphic designer and want to help out with some NFTs? Are you a copywriter seeing potential improvements in our communications?
Whatever it is, we would love to hear from you and see how we can make White Whale better for everybody.

## Docs
When in doubt, please take a look at our [litepaper](https://whitewhale.money/LitepaperV2.pdf) or our [documentation]([https://white-whale-defi-platform.github.io/docs/](https://ww0-1.gitbook.io/migaloo-docs/)).
