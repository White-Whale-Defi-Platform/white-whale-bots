# Code of Conduct
White Whale has an open, friendly, diverse, and welcoming community. We accept and respect everybody equally, but we don't tolerate harassing, trolling, or spamming. We are here to build, not to engage in toxic behavior.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
All White Whale contributors are required to be respectful towards other members of the team and the community. We expect everybody to act in the best interest of the community and the protocol.

## Conflict resolution
Contributors and community members should always try to solve conflicts communicatively. We encourage everybody to use appropriate communication channels to express their concerns and feelings. These channels include on-chain governance and social media platforms like Twitter and Discord. Always remember to focus on what is best for the community and protocol.

TLDR
Be good.
